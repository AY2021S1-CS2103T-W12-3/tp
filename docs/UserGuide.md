work. **Serenity** is a desktop application that helps CS2101 tutors manage their lessons. This application is optimized
for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI), meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a
command box.

This user guide serves to provide you with an in-depth documentation on how to set up and use our application.
